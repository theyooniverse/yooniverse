# Intro to Godot and Github
My GitHub desktop had a problem with cloning the repository to my desktop. It was not letting me move on to the next step by saying "This folder contains files. Git can only clone to empty folders." But then I somehow solved it by clicking "local path / choose" -> "desktop". I was writing an email about this to you but then I somehow figured it out while I was staring at the screenshot that I was about to send to you lol. Did I figure it out correctly? Also, Somehow I have a separate file called ".DS_Store" which was automatically created.
